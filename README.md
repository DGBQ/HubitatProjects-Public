## 🧭 Overview

Welcome to **DBQ’s HubitatProjects-Public** repository, a curated collection of Hubitat drivers  and possible future apps, maintained by a semi-retired software implementation project manager and smart home enthusiast. These projects are practical, approachable, and designed to be helpful for anyone looking to expand their Hubitat experience. They also reflect a hands-on, iterative learning process.  

All projects started as personal experiments using **Artificial intelligence (AI) assisted development**. Often, these experiments were conducted under the watchful eye of my cat, **Ollie**, who might stare at my screen for a few minutes before dramatically flopping onto my desk asleep. Over time, they evolved into functional, reliable solutions serving our household needs. While not “enterprise-grade,” they are tested, refined, and ready to use.  

The code in this repository was built using AI, following my specifications. This approach allowed me to explore **prompt engineering, iterative testing, and practical development** while learning the *do's and don’ts* of Hubitat automation and AI-driven development. Though I am not a professional developer, I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating with many skilled developers, and these projects reflect the lessons learned along the way. That said, an experienced Groovy developer may find the code choices and structure a bit irregular — I expect that, given my team member names were **Deep Seek, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot and Gork**.  

Currently, the repository includes tools like **Google Pollen Forecaster** and may expand in the future to **Google Air Quality Tracker** and **Google Weather Forecaster**, addressing localization gaps found in other drivers. All projects include full documentation, configuration guides, and usage examples — so you can explore, experiment, and hopefully enjoy the trials and tribulations of AI-driven development alongside me.

## 🤝 Contribution & Support

I welcome contributions, suggestions, and bug reports for all projects in this repository. Since each driver or app may have unique setup or behavior, please refer to the specific project README for detailed instructions.  

---

### 🐞 Reporting Bugs
For issues and bugs, please use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/google-pollen-forecaster/issues) page rather than the Hubitat Community forums. This ensures issues are tracked, discussed, and resolved in an organized manner.

- Provide a clear description of the issue.  
- Include relevant screenshots, logs, or steps to reproduce.  
- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates.

>💬 Kindly avoid posting bug reports directly in the Hubitat Community
>thread — it helps keep discussions organized and ensures your report is properly
>tracked and resolved.

### ✨ Contributing
- Fork a repository and experiment freely — this is a great way to learn and explore.  
- Pull requests are welcome if you have improvements or enhancements.  
- Follow Hubitat conventions and include clear, well-commented code.  
- Review the 📄 Contributing Guide for process and style rules.  

> 🟡Please note that response times for reviews or merges may vary due to personal
>  and professional commitments, but all thoughtful contributions will be read and
> appreciated. And yes, Ollie may supervise your work too—he gives it a solid 3 out of
>  5 dramatic flops.

> 💡 Tip: Respecting attribution helps keep open-source projects like this thriving,
> and it’s always fun to see how others experiment and build upon these drivers.
