### ➡️Commands

#### 🧮 Polling (Button)

> **Description:** Immediately forces a manual request to the Google Pollen API to fetch the very latest forecast data.

##### 🎯 Purpose and Use
This command is primarily used to:
* **Manually Force an Update:** Bypass the regular scheduled polling intervals to retrieve new data immediately.
* **Troubleshoot:** Quickly test the API key and location settings to verify connectivity.

#####  📌 Options and Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Valid Options |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **(None)** | This command is designed for manual execution and accepts no additional parameters. | N/A |

#####  💡 Hints and Best Practices
* **API Call Consumption:** Because the driver does **not** check a data cache before execution, clicking the **Poll** button will **always** consume one API call from your daily quota. Use this command sparingly.
* **Blockout Constraint:** If the `Use Blockout Dates?` preference is enabled in **Preferences** and the current date/time falls within a blockout period, the poll will be prevented.
* **Blockout Feedback:** If the poll is blocked, you will see a message in your Hubitat Logs (`Logs` tab), and the device's `apiStatus` attribute will change to **Blockout** until the blockout period ends.

#### 🔑 Google Pollen API Key

> **Description:** The unique security key provided by Google Cloud, which authenticates your Hubitat driver and authorizes data access to the Google Pollen API.

##### 🎯 Purpose and Use
This is a **mandatory prerequisite** for the driver. Without a valid API key, the driver cannot establish a connection, request, or receive *any* pollen forecast data. This field is the sole requirement for securing access to the Google API service.

##### 📌 Options and Values
| Field Type | Value Range | Default Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Text Input** | Full alphanumeric string provided by Google Cloud | (Empty) |

* **Note:** The key must be entered exactly as generated by Google Cloud.

##### 💡 Hints and Best Practices
* **Mandatory Field:** This field must be filled out for the driver to function.
* **Security:** Treat your API key as a password. It should never be shared publicly (e.g., in forum posts or shared screenshots), as it is linked directly to your Google Cloud billing account and quota.
* **Activation:** Ensure that the Google Pollen API service is enabled within your Google Cloud project for the provided key to be valid.

#### ⏰ Primary Daily Poll

> **Description:** Sets the mandatory, optimal time each day for the driver to attempt to fetch the latest Google Pollen Forecast data. This is the primary attempt to capture the new daily forecast data as soon as it is released.

##### 🎯 Purpose and Use
This setting is crucial for ensuring your device receives the newest daily forecast data as early as possible. It is intended to run at a time when the new forecast is typically available from the Google API, ensuring data freshness for the entire day.

##### 📌 Options and Values
| Field Type | Value Range | Default Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time Selector** | Hour, Minute, AM/PM Pick List | 6:00 AM |

* **Example:** Setting this to **6:00 AM** means the driver will schedule its main daily retrieval job for 6:00 AM every morning.

##### 💡 Hints and Best Practices
* **Required Field:** This is a required field, as the forecast data release is daily.
* **API Impact:** This setting guarantees **one API call per day** (at the specified time) dedicated to fetching the new daily forecast.
* **Timing:** The default of 6:00 AM is recommended as it balances early retrieval with typical hub schedules.

#### ⏰ Secondary Daily Poll

> **Description:** Sets a backup time each day for the driver to attempt to fetch the latest Google Pollen Forecast data. This is a fail-safe to ensure the new forecast data is captured if the Primary Daily Poll fails.

##### 🎯 Purpose and Use
This setting is essential for **driver reliability** and is used to:
* **Backup:** Act as a catch-all if the Primary Daily Poll failed due to a temporary network blip, an API delay, or if the Hubitat hub was briefly offline during the primary scheduled time.
* **Guarantee:** Ensure that regardless of temporary failures, the new daily forecast is captured later in the morning.

##### 📌 Options and Values
| Field Type | Value Range | Default Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time Selector** | Hour, Minute, AM/PM Pick List | 10:00 AM |

* **Example:** Setting this to **10:00 AM** means the driver will schedule its backup retrieval job four hours after the default Primary Poll.

##### 💡 Hints and Best Practices
* **Required Field:** This is a required field to maintain daily reliability.
* **API Impact:** This setting guarantees a **second API call per day** (at the specified time). Together, the Primary and Secondary polls ensure two dedicated API calls per 24 hours for the new forecast.
* **Spacing:** It is strongly recommended to set the Secondary Poll time **3 to 4 hours after** the Primary Poll time to allow enough time for transient issues to resolve.
